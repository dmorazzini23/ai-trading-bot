## Logging Configuration

 The AI trading bot supports several logging configuration flags to control output verbosity and format. Logger initialization is idempotentâ€”calling the setup multiple times will not create duplicate handlers. The setup routine now inspects existing handler *types* and ensures only one of each type is active, preventing accidental handler growth across repeated calls. A re-entrant lock guards the setup sequence so imports that indirectly invoke logging cannot deadlock during application startup.

### Environment Variables

- **`LOG_COMPACT_JSON`** (default: `false`): When enabled, uses compact JSON formatting that drops large extra payloads to prevent log truncation in terminals and journald.

- **`LOG_MARKET_FETCH`** (default: `false`): When enabled, logs periodic market fetch heartbeats at INFO level. When disabled, these messages are demoted to DEBUG level to reduce noise.

- **`LOG_LEVEL_YFINANCE`** (default: `WARNING`): Controls the log level for the `yfinance` package. Set to `INFO` or another level to troubleshoot provider interactions.
- **`LOG_QUIET_LIBRARIES`** (default: `charset_normalizer=INFO`): Comma-separated `logger=LEVEL` pairs used to suppress noisy third-party libraries.
- **`AI_TRADING_WARN_IF_MODEL_MISSING`** (default: `false`): When set, emits an `ML_MODEL_MISSING` warning if a configured model path cannot be found.

### Features

#### Emit-Once Logging
Startup banners and environment setup messages use emit-once logging to prevent duplicate messages during multiple initialization attempts:

- "Alpaca SDK is available" (or a warning if the SDK is missing)
- "FinBERT loaded successfully"
- Configuration verification messages

#### Compact JSON Format
When `LOG_COMPACT_JSON=true`, logs use a more compact format that:
- Omits non-essential extra fields
- Uses compact JSON serialization (no spaces)
- Prevents ellipsis truncation in typical terminals

#### Market Fetch Gating
The periodic `MARKET_FETCH` heartbeat logs can be controlled:
- `LOG_MARKET_FETCH=true`: Logs at INFO level (visible by default)
- `LOG_MARKET_FETCH=false`: Logs at DEBUG level (requires debug logging to see)

#### Risk Engine Quieting
Risk exposure update failures are demoted to DEBUG level when the trading context is not ready, reducing startup noise.

#### Automatic Secret Redaction
Any `extra` fields such as API keys, secrets, or URLs are sanitized before
being emitted to handlers, ensuring sensitive values are replaced with
`***REDACTED***`.  The :func:`ai_trading.logging.redact.redact_env` helper now
accepts ``drop=True`` to **remove** known sensitive keys instead of masking
them.  The early environment validation step uses this mode so that logs do
not contain secret key names or placeholder values.

#### Data Fetch Diagnostics
Daily price requests now log their parameters and outcome:

- `DAILY_FETCH_REQUEST` records the symbol, timeframe, and date range only when a cache miss triggers a fetch
- `DAILY_FETCH_CACHE_HIT` emits once on first cache use; subsequent hits appear only when debug logging is enabled
- `DAILY_FETCH_RESULT` reports the number of rows returned and whether the
  response came from cache
- Unauthorized feed responses trigger a quick entitlement check and switch to a
  permitted feed when available. If no alternative exists, operators are
  notified once.
- Empty bar responses are retried with an exponential backoff. The retry
  policy can be tuned via `FETCH_BARS_MAX_RETRIES`, `FETCH_BARS_BACKOFF_BASE`,
  and `FETCH_BARS_BACKOFF_CAP`. Logs include the remaining retry count,
  emit `ALPACA_FETCH_ABORTED` when a request is terminated early despite
  remaining retries, and emit `ALPACA_FETCH_RETRY_LIMIT` when no more attempts
  remain, allowing operators to diagnose persistent data issues quickly.

#### Backup Provider Usage
When the primary data source fails and the backup provider serves a window,
the system logs `BACKUP_PROVIDER_USED` and increments the
`backup_provider_used_total` Prometheus counter. The counter is labeled with
`provider` and `symbol`, allowing operators to track fallback frequency per
feed and instrument. Query the metric via the `/metrics` endpoint:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:$HEALTHCHECK_PORT/metrics | grep backup_provider_used_total
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# Enable compact logging for production
export LOG_COMPACT_JSON=true

# Hide market fetch heartbeats
export LOG_MARKET_FETCH=false

# Start the bot
python -m ai_trading.core.bot_engine
```

### Risk & Rollback

- Low risk changes (log-level modifications only)
- Toggle flags to revert behavior: `LOG_COMPACT_JSON=false`, `LOG_MARKET_FETCH=true`
- Revert to previous commit if needed
