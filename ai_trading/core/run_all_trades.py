"""Simplified trading loop for tests.

This module provides a small faÃ§ade around an injected API callable. It
ensures a trade log exists and adds a bit of behaviour used by tests:

* If the API callable raises an exception, a warning is logged and the
  symbol is skipped.
* When no symbols are provided the callable `sleep` is invoked exactly
  once and the function returns immediately.
* The trade log ``trades.csv`` is created on first use with a basic CSV
  header.
