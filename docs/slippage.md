# Slippage Modeling

The execution engine applies a deterministic slippage model defined in
`ai_trading/execution/slippage.py`. Prices are adjusted by a configurable number
of basis points (bps) to simulate execution friction. Before an order is
submitted a fresh quote is fetched to align the expected price with current
market conditions, reducing mismatches during fast moves.

If the delayed quote diverges from the reference price by more than the
configured threshold the engine now raises an assertion, preventing execution
against stale data.

## Configuration

- `EXECUTION_PARAMETERS["MAX_SLIPPAGE_BPS"]` sets the maximum allowed slippage.
- Override at runtime with the `MAX_SLIPPAGE_BPS` environment variable.
- `SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_TOLERANCE_BPS` controls the price buffer when a market order
  is converted to a limit order after the maximum slippage threshold is
  breached.
- The slippage threshold is adaptive: if a volatility feed is available the
  baseline limit is scaled by current symbol volatility, allowing wider bands
  for more turbulent markets.

## Diagnostics

After each order is filled, the engine logs a `SLIPPAGE_DIAGNOSTIC` entry comparing the expected
submission price with the average fill price. This aids in monitoring execution quality and ensures
that excessive slippage is detected early. When the calculated slippage exceeds the configured
threshold the engine converts market orders to limit orders at
`expected_price Â± tolerance` or reduces the order quantity. When volatility is
high this threshold is automatically increased to avoid unnecessary rejections.
