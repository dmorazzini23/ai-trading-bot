# Enhanced Trade Execution Debugging System

This system provides comprehensive debugging and tracking for the complete signal-to-execution pipeline, addressing critical issues like disconnected bot state, missing orders, and unexplained PnL changes.

## 🚨 Problem Solved

**Before**: Bot shows `positions=0` and `-$514 PnL` but no orders found in Alpaca order history.

**After**: Complete visibility into every step from signal generation to order completion with:
- Unique correlation IDs tracking orders from signal to fill
- Position reconciliation between bot and broker  
- Detailed PnL attribution explaining every dollar of profit/loss
- Comprehensive logging and debugging tools

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Execution Debug Tracker** (`ai_trading/execution/debug_tracker.py`)
   - Tracks complete order lifecycle with correlation IDs
   - Logs execution phases: signal → risk check → order prep → submission → fill
   - Maintains statistics on success/failure rates
   - Provides timeline view for troubleshooting

2. **Position Reconciler** (`ai_trading/execution/position_reconciler.py`)
   - Compares bot's internal positions vs broker API positions
   - Detects and classifies discrepancies (missing, phantom, quantity mismatch)
   - Auto-resolves low/medium severity issues
   - Alerts on high-severity position divergence

3. **PnL Attributor** (`ai_trading/execution/pnl_attributor.py`)
   - Tracks PnL by source: trades, fees, slippage, market movement, dividends
   - Explains PnL changes with detailed attribution
   - Maintains position snapshots for unrealized PnL tracking
   - Provides PnL explanation for any time window

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Enable Debugging in Your Bot

```python
from ai_trading.execution import enable_debug_mode, start_position_monitoring

# Enable at bot startup
enable_debug_mode(verbose=True, trace=False)

# Start position monitoring (checks every 5 minutes)
start_position_monitoring(api_client=your_alpaca_client, interval=300)
```

### 2. Track Signal-to-Execution

```python
from ai_trading.execution import log_signal_to_execution, log_execution_phase, ExecutionPhase

# Start tracking when signal is generated
correlation_id = log_signal_to_execution(
    symbol="AAPL",
    side="buy", 
    qty=100,
    signal_data={'strategy': 'momentum', 'confidence': 0.85}
)

# Log each execution phase
log_execution_phase(correlation_id, ExecutionPhase.RISK_CHECK, {'risk_score': 0.2})
log_execution_phase(correlation_id, ExecutionPhase.ORDER_SUBMITTED, {'order_id': 'alpaca_123'})
log_execution_phase(correlation_id, ExecutionPhase.ORDER_FILLED, {'fill_price': 150.00})
```

### 3. Track Positions and PnL

```python
from ai_trading.execution import update_bot_position, record_trade_pnl

# Update position after trade
update_bot_position("AAPL", 100, f"trade_{correlation_id}")

# Record PnL attribution
record_trade_pnl(
    symbol="AAPL",
    trade_qty=100,
    execution_price=150.00,
    avg_cost=148.00,
    fees=1.00,
    slippage=0.25,
    correlation_id=correlation_id
)
```

## 🛠️ Using the CLI Tool

The debugging CLI provides real-time visibility into execution health:

```bash
# Check overall system status
python debug_cli.py status

# Show recent executions
python debug_cli.py executions --limit 10

# Check for position discrepancies  
python debug_cli.py positions

# Analyze PnL breakdown
python debug_cli.py pnl AAPL

# Trace a specific order
python debug_cli.py trace AAPL_buy_1754510985158_7ed380f5

# Run comprehensive health check
python debug_cli.py health
```

## 🔍 Debugging Workflow

### When You See "PnL Without Positions"

1. **Check Execution Statistics**
   ```python
   from ai_trading.execution import get_execution_statistics
   stats = get_execution_statistics()
   print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.1%}")
   print(f"Recent failures: {stats['recent_failures']}")
   ```

2. **Force Position Reconciliation**
   ```python
   from ai_trading.execution import force_position_reconciliation
   discrepancies = force_position_reconciliation()
   for disc in discrepancies:
       print(f"{disc.symbol}: Bot={disc.bot_qty}, Broker={disc.broker_qty}")
   ```

3. **Analyze PnL Attribution**
   ```python
   from ai_trading.execution import get_portfolio_pnl_summary, explain_recent_pnl_changes
   
   summary = get_portfolio_pnl_summary()
   print(f"Total PnL: ${summary['total_pnl']:+.2f}")
   
   # Explain recent changes for specific symbol
   explanation = explain_recent_pnl_changes("AAPL", minutes=60)
   print(explanation['explanation'])
   ```

4. **Trace Order Execution**
   ```python
   from ai_trading.execution import get_debug_tracker
   
   tracker = get_debug_tracker()
   recent_executions = tracker.get_recent_executions(limit=5)
   
   for execution in recent_executions:
       correlation_id = execution.get('correlation_id')
       timeline = tracker.get_execution_timeline(correlation_id)
       print(f"Order {correlation_id}: {len(timeline)} phases")
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **Execution Success Rate**: Should be >95%
- **Position Discrepancies**: Should be 0 or auto-resolved
- **Stuck Orders**: Orders active >1 hour may be stuck
- **PnL Attribution**: All PnL should be attributable to sources

### Setting Up Alerts

```python
def check_execution_health():
    from ai_trading.execution import get_execution_statistics, get_position_discrepancies
    
    # Check success rate
    stats = get_execution_statistics()
    if stats['success_rate'] < 0.95:
        alert(f"Low execution success rate: {stats['success_rate']:.1%}")
    
    # Check position discrepancies
    discrepancies = get_position_discrepancies()
    high_severity = [d for d in discrepancies if d.severity == 'high']
    if high_severity:
        alert(f"High severity position discrepancies: {len(high_severity)}")

# Run every 5 minutes
schedule.every(5).minutes.do(check_execution_health)
```

## 🔧 Integration with Existing Code

### Minimal Changes Required

The system is designed to integrate with minimal changes to existing code:

```python
# BEFORE: Basic order execution
result = execution_engine.execute_order("AAPL", 100, "buy")

# AFTER: With debugging
from ai_trading.execution import log_signal_to_execution, log_execution_phase

correlation_id = log_signal_to_execution("AAPL", "buy", 100)
log_execution_phase(correlation_id, ExecutionPhase.RISK_CHECK)
result = execution_engine.execute_order("AAPL", 100, "buy")
if result:
    log_execution_phase(correlation_id, ExecutionPhase.ORDER_FILLED)
```

### Enhanced ExecutionEngine

The system includes hooks in the existing `ExecutionEngine`:

```python
# Enhanced execute_order method now includes:
- Correlation ID generation
- Phase-by-phase logging  
- Position update tracking
- PnL attribution
- Error handling and logging
```

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Logging Overhead**: <1ms per execution event
- **Memory Usage**: ~1KB per tracked order, bounded at 5000 orders
- **Storage**: JSON logs, auto-rotated
- **Network**: No additional API calls (uses existing position checks)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: "Import errors when using the debugging modules"**
A: Ensure environment variables are set. The modules require basic config even for testing.

**Q: "No execution events showing up"**  
A: Enable debug mode with `enable_debug_mode(verbose=True)` and check that correlation IDs are being passed through your execution flow.

**Q: "Position discrepancies not auto-resolving"**
A: Check the severity level. Only low/medium severity discrepancies auto-resolve. High severity requires manual intervention.

**Q: "PnL doesn't match what I expect"**
A: Use `explain_recent_pnl_changes()` to see detailed attribution. Check if market movement PnL is being calculated correctly.

### Support

For issues or questions:
1. Run `python debug_cli.py health` for system diagnostics
2. Check the execution timeline for failed orders
3. Verify position reconciliation is running
4. Review the integration guide for proper setup

This debugging system provides the visibility needed to quickly identify and resolve trading execution issues, ensuring your bot's internal state stays synchronized with actual market positions and PnL.
