## Problem Description

The following test failures have been identified and need to be addressed:

### Test Failures to Fix:
1. **TypeError:** `ExecutionEngine._reconcile_partial_fills() got an unexpected keyword argument 'requested_qty'`  
   - Affecting 3 tests in `test_fill_rate_calculation_fix.py`

2. **AttributeError:** `'list' object has no attribute 'keys'`  
   - In `test_signals.py:test_composite_signal_confidence`

These failures are directly related to the partial fill handling and signal evaluation issues identified in the logs, and should be included in the comprehensive fix.
